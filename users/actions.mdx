User actions provide direct moderation controls for managing problematic users in your community. These tools allow you to take immediate action against users who violate community guidelines, from temporary suspensions to permanent blocks.

## What are user actions and why use them

User actions complement content moderation by addressing the user behind problematic content. While content moderation handles individual posts, user actions target repeat offenders and persistent abuse patterns.

Common scenarios for user actions:

- **Persistent violators** identified through [trust levels](/users/trust-levels) or [fraud detection](/users/fraud-detection)
- **Spam accounts** posting promotional content repeatedly
- **Coordinated attacks** from multiple related accounts
- **Ban evasion** attempts by previously blocked users
- **Escalated violations** that warrant account-level consequences

User actions help you:

- **Stop ongoing abuse** immediately without waiting for content-level detection
- **Send clear signals** to users about acceptable behavior
- **Protect your community** from repeat offenders

## Built-in actions

The system provides three essential user actions for comprehensive account management:

### Block (Permanent Ban)

Permanently prevents a user from submitting content for moderation.

**When to use:**

- Spam accounts with no legitimate content
- Users repeatedly violating major community guidelines
- Accounts identified as malicious through fraud detection
- Coordinated attacks or bot networks

**Technical behavior:**

- User status set to `"blocked"`
- All future content submissions are rejected
- `user.block.until` field set to `null` (permanent)
- `user.block.reason` stores the reason provided

### Suspend (Temporary Ban)

Temporarily prevents a user from submitting content for a specified period.

**When to use:**

- First-time serious violations that warrant a cooling-off period
- Users who might reform with temporary consequences
- Escalating enforcement before permanent blocks
- Accounts needing investigation time

**Technical behavior:**

- User status set to `"suspended"`
- Content submissions rejected until suspension ends
- `user.block.until` field set to suspension end time
- `user.block.reason` stores the reason provided
- Automatic reinstatement when period expires

### Enable (Remove Block/Suspension)

Removes existing blocks or suspensions, restoring normal access.

**When to use:**

- Appeals that have been approved
- Mistaken blocks that need correction
- Policy changes requiring user reinstatement
- Early release from suspensions for good behavior

**Technical behavior:**

- User status reset to normal
- Content submission access restored
- Block fields cleared from user record

## Action execution

User actions can be executed through both the dashboard interface and programmatically via API.

### Dashboard execution

1. Navigate to the user detail page in the [user dashboard](https://moderationapi.com/app/users)
2. Select the appropriate action (Block, Suspend, or Enable)
3. Provide a reason and any additional details
4. Confirm the action

### API execution

Execute actions programmatically using the Author API:

```javascript
// Block a user permanently
const blockResponse = await fetch("/api/authors/{authorId}/block", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    reason: "Repeated spam violations",
    permanent: true,
  }),
});

// Suspend a user for 7 days
const suspendResponse = await fetch("/api/authors/{authorId}/suspend", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    reason: "Harassment of other users",
    duration: "7d",
  }),
});
```

See the [Author API documentation](/api-reference/author) for complete endpoint details.

## Action customization

All user actions support customizable input to provide context and maintain moderation records:

### Reason field

Always provide clear reasons for actions:

- **Required for documentation** and potential appeals
- **Visible to moderators** in user timeline
- **Returned in API responses** for application logic
- **Helps identify patterns** in violation types

### Value options

Configure predefined reason options or allow free text:

- **Dropdown options**: "Spam", "Harassment", "Fraud", "Policy Violation"
- **Free text input**: Custom reasons for specific situations
- **Combined approach**: Predefined categories with additional notes field

### Duration settings (Suspend only)

Flexible suspension periods:

- **Predefined options**: 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month
- **Custom duration**: Specify exact end date/time
- **Progressive enforcement**: Longer suspensions for repeat offenders

## Technical implementation

User actions modify several fields returned in API responses, allowing seamless integration with your application logic.

### Status fields

Monitor user status through API responses:

```javascript
{
  "id": "user123",
  "status": "suspended", // "active", "blocked", "suspended"
  "block": {
    "until": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z", // null for permanent blocks
    "reason": "Harassment of other users",
  }
}
```

### Application integration

Use status information in your application:

```javascript
// Check if user can post content
if (user.status === "blocked") {
  return { error: "Account permanently blocked" };
}

if (user.status === "suspended") {
  const suspensionEnd = new Date(user.block.until);
  if (suspensionEnd > new Date()) {
    return {
      error: `Account suspended until ${suspensionEnd.toLocaleDateString()}`,
    };
  }
}

// User can post normally
return { success: true };
```

### Content submission integration

The system automatically handles blocked/suspended users when content is submitted to [moderation endpoints](/api-reference/moderate/analyze-text), but you can also check status proactively in your application.

## Custom actions

Beyond built-in actions, you can create custom author-level actions for specialized moderation workflows:

- **Warning systems**: Formal warnings that don't restrict access
- **Verification requirements**: Require additional account verification
- **Feature restrictions**: Limit specific platform features
- **Escalation triggers**: Automatically escalate to senior moderators

To create custom actions, choose "Author level action" when creating a new action in the dashboard. These appear alongside built-in actions on user detail pages.

## Webhooks and notifications

Receive real-time notifications when user actions are executed through [webhook integration](/review-queues/webhooks):

**Common webhook use cases:**

- **Sync with external systems** like customer support platforms
- **Trigger email notifications** to affected users
- **Update internal user databases** with moderation status
- **Log actions for compliance** and audit requirements
- **Alert security teams** about fraud-related blocks

Configure webhooks to receive instant notifications whenever blocks, suspensions, or other user actions are executed.

## Timeline and tracking

All user actions are automatically tracked in the user dashboard timeline:

- **Action history**: Complete chronological record of all actions taken
- **Moderator attribution**: Which team member executed each action
- **Reason logging**: Full context for every moderation decision
- **Audit trail**: Comprehensive record for compliance and appeals

This timeline helps moderators understand user history and make informed decisions about future actions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can blocked users still view content?

User actions only prevent content submission for moderation. They don't affect content viewing unless you implement additional restrictions in your application using the status fields.

### What happens to existing content when a user is blocked?

Existing content remains in your system and review queues. User actions only prevent new submissions. You may want to review existing content from blocked users separately.

### Can suspended users see their suspension status?

The system provides the suspension information through API responses, but displaying this to users depends on your application implementation. Use the `user.block.until` and `user.block.reason` fields to show appropriate messages.

### How do I handle ban appeals?

Use the Enable action to reinstate users after successful appeals. The action history timeline maintains a record of the original block and subsequent reinstatement for transparency.

### Can I modify suspension periods after they're set?

You can use the Enable action to end suspensions early, or apply a new Suspend action to extend the period. Each action creates a new timeline entry for full audit tracking.

### Do user actions work with trust levels and fraud detection?

Yes, user actions complement these systems perfectly. High fraud risk scores or low trust levels often indicate when user actions are needed. The systems work together to provide comprehensive user management.
