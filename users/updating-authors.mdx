You can update author information to improve trust scoring and fraud detection in your moderation system. Author updates can be made through either the API or the dashboard interface.

## Author Creation

Authors are automatically created when an `author_id` is included in [submit content requests](/api-reference/content/submit-content). However, you can also manually create authors using the API before submitting content.

We recommend adding detailed author information using the update endpoint after automatic creation, or creating authors ahead of time with complete details to improve initial trust scoring accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- **Dashboard**: You need the moderator role for your project
- **API**: Any valid API key for the project

## Available Fields

### Basic Information

These fields are displayed in the dashboard for easier author management:

- `name`: The author's display name
- `email`: Author's email address
- `profile_picture`: URL to the author's profile image
- `external_link`: URL to the author's profile on your platform or other external resources. Will add a clickable link in the dashboard.

### Metadata

The `metadata` field is a flexible JSON object that can store any additional author information:

- **Limits**: Maximum 25 keys with 1 level of nesting
- **Usage**: Included in webhooks and author API responses
- **Purpose**: Store custom data relevant to your use case

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "account_type": "premium",
    "signup_source": "mobile_app",
    "custom_tags": ["verified_creator", "high_engagement"],
    "preferences": {
      "notifications": true,
      "public_profile": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Built-in Metadata Fields

These special metadata fields are used for trust levels and fraud detection, and are rendered in the dashboard:

- `email_verified`: Boolean indicating if email is verified
- `phone_verified`: Boolean indicating if phone number is verified
- `identity_verified`: Boolean indicating if identity has been verified
- `is_paying_customer`: Boolean indicating if the user is a paying customer

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "email_verified": true,
    "phone_verified": false,
    "identity_verified": true,
    "is_paying_customer": true
  }
}
```

### Trust Level Override

The `manual_trust_level` field allows you to override automatic trust level calculations:

- **Use cases**: Permanently promote or demote specific users
- **Reset**: Set to `null` to return to automatic trust level calculation
- **Impact**: Affects moderation decisions and user permissions

Learn more about trust levels and how they work in our [Trust Levels Article](/users/trust-levels).

### Timestamps

These timestamp fields help with trust scoring and fraud detection:

- `first_seen`: When the author was first encountered in your system
- `last_seen`: The author's most recent activity timestamp

Both fields accept timestamp format and contribute to the automatic trust level calculation.

## Making Updates

#### Using API

Use the [PUT /authors/{id} endpoint](/api-reference/author/update-author-details) to programmatically update author information. If you need to create a new author, use the [POST /authors/ endpoint](/api-reference/author/create-a-new-author).

Here's a complete example of updating an author with all available fields:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "profile_picture": "https://example.com/avatars/johndoe.jpg",
  "external_link": "https://myplatform.com/users/johndoe",
  "metadata": {
    "email_verified": true,
    "phone_verified": true,
    "identity_verified": false,
    "is_paying_customer": true,
    "account_type": "premium",
    "signup_source": "mobile_app",
    "preferences": {
      "notifications": true
    }
  },
  "manual_trust_level": 3,
  "first_seen": 1577836800000,
  "last_seen": 1672531200000
}
```

#### Using Dashboard

Navigate to the [Authors section](https://moderationapi.com/app/users) in your project dashboard to update author details through the web interface.
