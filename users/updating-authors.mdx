You can update author information to improve trust scoring and fraud detection in your moderation system. Author updates can be made through either the API or the dashboard interface.

## Prerequisites

- **Dashboard**: You need the moderator role for your project
- **API**: Any valid API key for the project

## Available Fields

### Basic Information

**Name, Email, and Profile Picture**
These fields are displayed in the dashboard for easier author management:

- `name`: The author's display name
- `email`: Author's email address
- `profile_picture`: URL to the author's profile image

**External Link**
The `external_link` field adds a clickable button in the dashboard, useful for linking to the author's profile on your platform or other external resources.

### Metadata

The `metadata` field is a flexible JSON object that can store any additional author information:

- **Limits**: Maximum 25 keys with 1 level of nesting
- **Usage**: Included in webhooks and author API responses
- **Purpose**: Store custom data relevant to your use case

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "account_type": "premium",
    "signup_source": "mobile_app",
    "custom_tags": ["verified_creator", "high_engagement"],
    "preferences": {
      "notifications": true,
      "public_profile": false
    }
  }
}
```

#### Built-in Metadata Fields

These special metadata fields are used for trust levels and fraud detection, and are rendered in the dashboard:

- `email_verified`: Boolean indicating if email is verified
- `phone_verified`: Boolean indicating if phone number is verified
- `identity_verified`: Boolean indicating if identity has been verified
- `is_paying_customer`: Boolean indicating if the user is a paying customer

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "email_verified": true,
    "phone_verified": false,
    "identity_verified": true,
    "is_paying_customer": true
  }
}
```

### Trust Level Override

The `manual_trust_level` field allows you to override automatic trust level calculations:

- **Use cases**: Permanently promote or demote specific users
- **Reset**: Set to `null` to return to automatic trust level calculation
- **Impact**: Affects moderation decisions and user permissions

Learn more about trust levels and how they work in our [Trust Levels Guide](#) (coming soon).

### Timestamps

These timestamp fields help with trust scoring and fraud detection:

- `first_seen`: When the author was first encountered in your system
- `last_seen`: The author's most recent activity timestamp

Both fields accept ISO 8601 timestamp format and contribute to the automatic trust level calculation.

## Making Updates

**API**: Use the [PUT /authors/{id} endpoint](/api-reference/authors/update) to programmatically update author information.

**Dashboard**: Navigate to the Authors section in your project dashboard to update author details through the web interface.
