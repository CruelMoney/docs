## Overview

Enabling user management in Moderation API solves some of the most common moderation challenges for community platforms.

This is done by introducing the concept of authors (users) in the moderation process. Each author has a [trust level](/users/trust-levels) that is automatically adjusted based on their behavior and moderation history.

User management lets you:

- Tailor and improve moderation accuracy based on trust levels
- Skip moderation for trusted users
- Block or suspend users
- Fraud detection using behavioral analysis

## Get started

Just add an `authorId` when submitting content to a [moderation
endpoint](/api-reference/moderate/analyze-text).

We recommend using the user ID from your system
but any unique identifier like email or username will work.

You should now see your users appear in the [user dashboard](https://moderationapi.com/app/users).

<Note>
  There might be a delay in user creation and trust level calculation. This is
  because we process users in batches to optimize performance.
