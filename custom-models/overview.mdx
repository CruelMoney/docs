## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define labels">For example "Allowed" and "Blocked".</Step>
  <Step title="Add training data">
    Upload a CSV or use content you've already submitted to Moderation API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Annotate data">
    If your training data is missing labels, you can annotate it using our
    annotation tools.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Begin training">
    Start the training and wait for it to finish.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use your new model ">
    Once your model is trained, you can use it your projects in Moderation API.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Training data

It is recommended that you have some examples of your content, ideally 200+ examples, but you can get started with as little as 20 examples.

If you don't have any data to upload, you can start collecting it today with Moderation API. Everything submitted using the [text moderation endpoint](/api-reference) will we available as training data for your custom model.

## Self-learning models

Custom models are self-learning, which means that they will improve over time as you use them. This is done by using the [review queue](/review-queues) and correcting the model when it makes a mistake.
