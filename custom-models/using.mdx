When a model training has completed, the model will show up alongside all the pre-built models in your project, and you can [add it like any other model](/content-moderation/adding-models).

### Response signature

Custom models have a similar response signature to the [pre-built classifiers](/models/classifier-overview).

Each model returns an object with the detected label and the respective scores. This object is added to the API response under the model's key.

<ResponseField name="label" type="string" required>
  The most probable label. This will always be the label with the highest score.
  Returns null if the analyzer fails.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="score" type="number" required>
  The score of the label. From 0-1 score with 1 meaning a high probability of
  being correct.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="label_scores" type="object" required>
  An object containing all the label scores.
</ResponseField>
