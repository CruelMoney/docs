<Note>
  Depending on your plan your might have a limited number of projects available.
</Note>

You can create a new project from the [projects page](https://dash.moderationapi.com/projects) on your dashboard.<br></br>

We recommend to create a project for each part of your application. For example, if you have a chat application, you can create a project for the chat messages and another project for the user profiles. <br></br>

It is also possible to create a single project for all the content of your application. However, this is not recommended because it makes it harder to manage, and can possibly lead to higher costs. <br></br>

Lastly, it is recommended to create a seperate proejct project for your development environment to keep the data separate from your production environment and to avoid accidentally using your production API key in your development environment. <br></br>

## Changing project name

You can change the name of your project at any time. The name is only used for your own reference.<br></br>

Find the project name in the project settings page.<br></br>
