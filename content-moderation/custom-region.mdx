Using a custom region is useful if you want to optimize your projects performance. You can select region near your own servers to reduce latency.

To use a custom region, please contact us at [support@moderationapi.com](mailto:support@moderationapi.com) and we'll set it up for you.

<Callout type="info">
  The default region is in central Europe, Frankfurt `eu-central-1`. If your
  servers are also in central Europe, you probably don't need to set a custom
  region.
