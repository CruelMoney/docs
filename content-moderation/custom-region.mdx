You can use a custom region to optimize your projects performance or to comply with local regulations. We recommend to select a region near your own servers to reduce latency.

To use a custom region, please contact us at [support@moderationapi.com](mailto:support@moderationapi.com) and we'll set it up for you. Custom regions are available for enterprise customers.

<Info>
  The default region is in central Europe, Frankfurt `eu-central-1`. If your
  servers are also in central Europe, you probably don't need to set a custom
  region.
