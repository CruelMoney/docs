<Warning>
  Keep your API key secret. Anyone with your API key can use your project.
</Warning>
<Warning>
  Deleting a project also deletes all API keys associated with the project.
</Warning>

After you've created a project, you can find the API key in the project
integration page in the sidebar.<br></br>

<Frame>
  <img className="block " src="/images/api-key.png" alt="Project API key" />
</Frame>

To reset the API key, click the "Reset API key" button. This will invalidate the old API key and generate a new one. <br></br>
