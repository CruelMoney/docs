Moderation API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted or is formatted incorrectly, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Moderation API's servers.

## Response signature

Error responses are returned with a JSON object with the following signature:

<ResponseField name="code" type="string" required>
  The error code. `BAD_REQUEST`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `FORBIDDEN`, `NOT_FOUND`,
  `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`, `TOO_MANY_REQUESTS`, `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`,
  `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="message" type="string" required>
  A human-readable message providing more details about the error.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="issues" type="array">
  An array of issues that caused the error. For example input fields that are
  invalid.

## Handling errors

Our API can return errors for many reasons, such as a authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API errors to avoid making your own service unavailable.
