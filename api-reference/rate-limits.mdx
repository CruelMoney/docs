Different plans have different rate limit tiers based on your subscription plan. You can view your organization's current rate limit tier in your [dashboard](https://dash.moderationapi.com/usage).

To request an increased rate limit, please [contact our sales team](https://moderationapi.com/sales).

## Rate limit headers

The API returns rate limit information in the response headers for every request:

| Header                  | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests you can make in the current time window                |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current time window                           |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Unix timestamp (in seconds) when your rate limit will reset                           |
| `Retry-After`           | Number of seconds to wait before retrying (only included when rate limit is exceeded) |

### Example response headers

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1699564800
```

## Handling rate limits

A basic technique for integrations to gracefully handle limiting is to watch for `429` status codes and build in a retry mechanism. The retry mechanism should follow an exponential backoff schedule to reduce request volume when necessary.

When you exceed your rate limit, the API will return a `429` error with a message indicating how long to wait before retrying. Use the `Retry-After` header to determine when to make your next request.

### Example error response

When rate limited, you'll receive a response like:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 10 seconds."
}
```

The response will include the `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait.

## Checking your rate limit

You can check your current rate limit in your [dashboard under usage](https://dash.moderationapi.com/usage).
