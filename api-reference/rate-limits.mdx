The default API rate limit is 60 requests per minute.

We may reduce limits to prevent abuse, or increase limits to enable high-traffic applications. To request an increased rate limit, please contact support.

## Handling rate limts

A basic technique for integrations to gracefully handle limiting is to watch for `429` status codes and build in a retry mechanism. The retry mechanism should follow an exponential backoff schedule to reduce request volume when necessary.

## Checking your rate limit

You can check your current rate limit in your [dashboard under usage](https://moderationapi.com/app/usage).

You might also want to check what your peak usage is for a given time period. You can do in the [analytics page](https://moderationapi.com/app/analytics) in your dashboard. Check the Peak RPM chart. This is useful to see if you are close to hitting your rate limit.
