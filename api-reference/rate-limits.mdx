The default API rate limit is 10 requests per 10 seconds.

We may reduce limits to prevent abuse, or increase limits to enable high-traffic applications. To request an increased rate limit, please contact support.

### Handling rate limts

A basic technique for integrations to gracefully handle limiting is to watch for `429` status codes and build in a retry mechanism. The retry mechanism should follow an exponential backoff schedule to reduce request volume when necessary.
