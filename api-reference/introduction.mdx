## Welcome

## Not a developer?

If you're not a developer, you can still use the API. We have many [integrations and no-code solutions](https://moderationapi.com/integrations) that allows you to create projects and moderate content without writing a single line of code.

<Note>
  If you're not looking to build API reference documentation, you can delete
  this section by removing the api-reference folder.
