api: "GET https://moderationapi.com/api/v1/auth"

The Moderation API uses [API keys](/content-moderation/manage-api-key) to authenticate requests. Each project has its own API key. You can view and manage your API keys in the [dashboard](https://moderationapi.com/dashboard) -> Project -> Integrate.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Don't share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed with the Authorization header when making a HTTP request. Provide your API key prefixed with `Bearer` as the value of the Authorization header.

<ResponseExample>
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Valid API key",
  "project": "My Project Name"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

You must make all API calls over HTTPS. Calls that you make over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

<Note>
  We recommend creating two projects in your dashboard, one for development and
  one for production. This way you can create tokens for both environments.
