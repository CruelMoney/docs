The moderation queue is a streamlined way to manually moderate content. It's an optional addition to the automated moderation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit content">
    Content submitted through the [moderation endpoint](/api-reference) will
    enter the queue based on the queues filter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take actions">
    The queue is a list of content that needs to be moderated. You can take
    [actions](/content-queues/actions) on the content, such as approving or
    rejecting it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolve content">
    The goal is to [resolve](/content-queues/using-queues#resolving-content) all
    content in the queue. Once all content is resolved, the queue is empty.
    Items can be resolved by certain actions or by resolving them manually.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Some of the things you can do with content queues:

- Review content before it's published
- Perform a manual review of content that was automatically rejected
- Review content that was flagged by users
- Ban users that are submitting unwanted content
- Improve your models by correcting mistakes
- Get insights into the content that is being submitted
