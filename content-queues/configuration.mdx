To create a new queue you can press the plus button in side bar on the queue dashboard or simply [create a new queue here](https://moderationapi.com/app/moderation/new).

<Note>Feel free to edit the default queue if it doesn't match your needs.</Note>

## Configuring a queue

When you create or update a queue you can decide what items should be sent to the queue using the configuration.

### Filter by projects

You can select which projects should be included in the queue. If you don't select any projects, all projects will be included.

<Info>
  #### Example - Dedicated projects
  <span>
    Create a project for each type of content you want to moderate. For example,
    you could create a project for user profiles and another for comments. You
    can then have a queue dedicated for profiles and another for comments.
  </span>
</Info>

### Filter by date or time

You can select a date range to include items from. If you don't select a date range, all items will be included.

It is recommended to only include items from the last 3 months to ensure the queue doesn't get too large.

Depending on your throughput, you may want to include a shorter time range.

### Filter by language

You can select which languages should be included in the queue. If you don't select any languages, all languages will be included.

One approach is to have a queues dedicated to each language, and have your moderators assigned based on the language they speak.

### Filter by actions taken on items

If you choose to filter by actions taken on items, the queue will only contain items that have had one of the selected actions executed.

This is a powerful way to create queues for items that need to be reviewed, or items that have been flagged by users.

<Info>
  #### Example - Flagging queue
  <span>
    You can create an action called "Flag" and have users flag items they think
    should be reviewed. You can then create a queue that only contains items
    that have been flagged.
  </span>
</Info>

<Info>
  #### Example - Escalated queue
  <span>
    You can create an action called "Escalated" and have moderators escalate
    items they think should be reviewed by a senior moderator. You can then
    create a queue that only contains items that have been escalated.
  </span>
</Info>

### Filter by flags

You can decide whether to show items that have been flagged by your project models ([see flagging thresholds](/content-moderation/flagging-thresholds)) or items that have not been flagged or all items.

It is recommended to focus on items that have been flagged by your project, and adjusting the flagging thresholds to match your needs.

### Filter by labels

You can choose to focus your queue on specific labels. For example, you could create a queue that only contains items that have been labelled as "Toxic" or "Negative".

This way you can create higher priority queues for items that are more likely to be problematic.

**Label score**

Additionally you can also require those labels to have a minimum score. For example, you could create a queue that only contains items that have been labelled as "Toxic" with a confidence of 90% or higher.

### Items order

By default the queue will show items in the order they were created. This is to ensure that items that have been in the queue for a long time are not forgotten.

You can change this to show the newest items first.

## Updating the configuration

When you update the configuration of a queue, the queue will instantly update to show only items matching the new configuration.

You can safely update the configuration of a queue to test different configurations, and then revert back to the original configuration.

Items you've previously resolved will still be resolved, and wont reappear in the queue.
