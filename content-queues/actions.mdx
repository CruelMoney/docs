You can create custom actions to execute on content or users. The actions will show up in the selected moderation queues, and can be executed by moderators.<br></br>

On way of using actions is to create a custom queues that shows only content that have had a specific action performed. This way you can move content between queues using actions. <br></br>

Actions can also be performed programmatically using the [execute action endpoint](/api-reference/execute-an-action).

We recommend using actions for things like removing content from your platform, or banning users. <br></br>

## Resolving an item when action is executed

Actions can be configured to resolve the item when the action is executed. This means that the item will be removed from the queue when the action is executed.

## Adding a value to an action

You can add a value to an action. This value can be used to add a reason for the action, or to add a duration for a ban etc. <br></br>

## Integrating actions

To integrate actions in your application you can use [webhooks](/content-queues/webhooks) or use one of our [platform plugins](https://moderationapi.com/integrations).
