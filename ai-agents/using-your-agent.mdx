After you've created an agent, it will show up alongside all the pre-built models in your project. Because AI agents are specialized models, you can [add them just like any other model](/content-moderation/adding-models).

The agent will classify your content based on the safety categories and rules you've defined when creating the agent.

### Response signature

AI agents have a similar response signature to the [pre-built classifiers](/models/classifier-overview), with the addition of a `rule` field.

<ResponseField name="label" type="string" required>
  The label of the rule that was triggered. Returns NEUTRAL if no rules were
  triggered.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="score" type="number" required>
  The score of the most probable label. LLama Guard returns a probability score
  between 0 and 1, whereas GPT-4o-mini returns a binary classification 1 or 0.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="label_scores" type="object" required>
  An object containing all the rules with either 0 or 1 as the score.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="rule" type="string">
  The description of the rule that was triggered. Returns null if no rules were
  triggered.
</ResponseField>
