After you've created an agent, the model will show up alongside all the ready-made models in your project, and you can [add it like any other model](/content-moderation/adding-models).

### Response signature

AI agents have a similar response signature to the [ready-made classifiers](/models/classifier-overview), with the addition of a `rule` field.

<ResponseField name="label" type="string" required>
  The label of the rule that was triggered. Returns NEUTRAL if no rules were
  triggered.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="score" type="number" required>
  The score of the most probable label. Always 1 or 0.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="label_scores" type="object" required>
  An object containing all the rules with either 0 or 1 as the score.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="rule" type="string">
  The description of the rule that was triggered. Returns null if no rules were
  triggered.
</ResponseField>
