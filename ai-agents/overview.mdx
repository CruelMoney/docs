AI Agents are great if you don't have any training data, or if you want to create custom policies for your content.

To create an AI agent you simply explain what your content policies are, and the AI agent will classify content based on your instructions.

## How it works

    Add content policies that the agent should follow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use your AI agent">
    Use the agent to classify your content in your projects.
  </Step>
</Steps>
