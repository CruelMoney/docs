> **Dry-run mode:** If you want to analyze production data but don't want to block content, enable "dry-run" in your project settings.

> With dry-run enabled, the API still analyzes content but it always returns `flagged: false` - yet content still shows in the review queue. This way you can implement your moderation workflows and start testing your project configuration without actually blocking content.
