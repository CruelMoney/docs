Content will be automatically added to review queues when analyzed using a [moderation endpoint](/content-moderation/submit-content).

You can edit a queues filter to change which content shows up in a given review queue. See [how to configure a queue](/review-queues/configuration#configuring-a-queue) for more information.

<Note>
  If you set the `doNotStore` flag to `true` when calling the API, the content
  will not be stored in the database and as a result the content will not be
  available to preview anywhere in the dashboard including the review queue.
