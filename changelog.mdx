### New Author Dashboard

We've introduced a new comprehensive author-level dashboard system to enhance end user management.

- New Author Detail Pages: Comprehensive user profiles with complete activity
  overview, trust levels, moderation history, and detailed analytics
  - Summary Tab: Trust level management, sentiment analysis, message statistics, and
    top violation categories

    and advanced filtering
  - Fraud Detection Tab: Advanced behavioral analysis including bot detection,
    location anomalies, device fingerprinting, and risk assessment
  - Metadata Tab: Technical user information and account details

### Trust Level System

A new trust level system allows you to tailor moderation actions based on user behavior and find bad actors more easily.

- Automated Trust Adjustments: System automatically adjusts trust levels based on
  user behavior and moderation history
- Manually upgrade or downgrade trust levels as needed
- Trust Level Impact: Trust levels can be consumed via the API or to
  influence moderation decisions, such as auto-approving content from high-trust users

### Author-Level Moderation Actions

- Comprehensive User Actions: Block, suspend, and unblock users directly from their
  profile pages
- Duration-Based Suspensions: Flexible temporary blocks with customizable time
  periods (1 hour to 1 year)
- Remember to set up webhooks to handle actions taken on authors
