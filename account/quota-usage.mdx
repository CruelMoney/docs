## Included quota

All Moderation API plans include a certain amount of quota. This quota is used when you submit content for moderation.

The included quota is different for each plan. See the [pricing page](/pricing) for more information.

Custom plans can be created with a different quota for use cases where you need more quota, so please [reach out](https://moderationapi.com/sales) if you need more quota.

## Exceeding the included quota

By default, the API will block requests when you've exceeded the included quota and repond with a `429 status code`. If you want to continue submitting content, you can **upgrade** your plan or enable **pay-as-you-go**.

### Upgrade to a higher plan

If you upgrade to a higher plan, your quota will immediately be reset to the included quota for the new plan.

### Pay-as-you-go

If you enable pay-as-you-go, you will be billed for the quota you use on top of your included quota. This is useful if you want to avoid being blocked when you exceed the included quota.

#### When is pay-as-you-go billed?

Pay-as-you-go is billed monthly at the same time as your subscription.

## When does the quota reset?

Your quota resets at the beginning of your billing cycle.

For example, if you have a monthly plan, your quota will reset on the day that you started your plan. You can also see the start date of your billing cycle in the dashboard on the [billing page](https://moderationapi.com/app/billing).

## How is the quota usage calculated?

The quota usage is calculated based on the number of requests you make to the API, which models you use, and the plan your account is on.

You can see the quota usage for a request in the response.

- Pre-built text models use 1 quota unit per request no matter how many models you use.
- Pre-built image models use 3 quota units per image.
- Custom models and AI Agents use 1 quota unit per request per model.
- Some exceptions might apply.

#### Example:

- Your project is configured with 5 pre-built text models and 1 AI Agent.
  - 5 pre-built text models = 1 quota unit per request
  - 1 AI Agent = 1 quota unit per request
  - Total quota usage = 2 quota units per request
  - Submit 10 requests to the API = 10 x 2 quota units = 20 quota units
