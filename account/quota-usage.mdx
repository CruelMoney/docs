Depending on your plan you have a certain amount of quota. You can see your quota and usage in the [usage dashboard](https://moderationapi.com/app/usage).<br />

Each request to your project will use a certain amount of quota. Usually this is 1 quota per request, but some models use more quota. You can see the quota usage per model when you add it to your project.<br />

<Warning>
  If you run out of quota, the API will respond with an error and status code
  `403`.
</Warning>

## Quota period

The quota period is the period of time in which your quota is calculated. For example, if your quota period is 1 month, your quota will be reset every month. You can see your current quota period in the [usage dashboard](https://moderationapi.com/app/usage).<br />

Most accounts have a quota period of 1 month from the 1st of the month to the last day of the month. If you have a custom plan, your quota period may be different.

## Pay-as-you-go

You can enable pay-as-you-go on your account. This means that you will be charged for any usage above your plan's quota. You can enable pay-as-you-go in the [usage dashboard](https://moderationapi.com/app/usage).<br />

This is useful if you want to make sure your API requests are never rejected, or if you want to use just a little bit more quota than your plan allows.
