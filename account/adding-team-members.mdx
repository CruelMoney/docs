Visit the [team management page](https://moderationapi.com/app/team) to add team members to your organization.

You can add team members by entering their email address. They will receive an email invitation to join your organization.

## Roles

There are three roles in an organization:

- **Owner**: The owner has full access to the organization and can manage team members and billing. Only one owner can exist per organization and cannot be removed or changed.
- **Admin**: The admin has full access to the organization and can manage team members and billing.
- **Developer**: The developer can access and change the projects, models, and review queues, but cannot manage team members or billing.
- **Moderator**: The moderator can access and use the review queues, but cannot manage team members, billing, projects, or models. You can limit the access of moderators to specific queues.
