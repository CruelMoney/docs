title: "Wordlists"

Some models can be configured to use wordlists. Wordlists are used to add custom words to the models vocabulary. <br></br>

#### Allowlists

Allowlists are used to allow certain words. For example, if you want to allow the word `apple` in a model, you can add it to a wordlist and then add the wordlist as `allowlist` to the model. Afterwards that model wont match the word apple. <br></br>

#### Blocklists

Blocklists are used to block certain words. For example, if you want to block the word `windows` in a model, you can add it to a wordlist and then add the wordlist as `blocklist` to the model. Afterwards that model will start matching the word windows. <br></br>

## Creating a wordlist

To create a new wordlist:

1. Go to [models in the dashboard](https://moderationapi.com/app/models/wordlists)
2. Select Wordlists in the sidebar
3. Press "Create new wordlist"
4. Give the wordlist a name
5. Start adding words
6. Visit your project and add the wordlist to a model

## Smart lists vs. Strict mode

The wordlists are smart and automatically understand inflections of words. For example, if you add the word `run` to a wordlist, the model will also recognize `running`, `ran` and `ruuuun` etc. <br></br>

By default the wordlist is checked against a word's base form, so you only need to add the base form of each word.
You can enable strict comparison to check the exact word and manually add all inflections.
