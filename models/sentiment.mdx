The sentiment analyzer is trained to detect the sentiment of a text. It can detect positive, negative and neutral sentiment.<br/>

<Note>
  Sentiment analysis is a very subjective task. The model is trained on a large
  dataset, but positive and negative might mean something else in your context.

```json Response Example:
{
  "label": "NEGATIVE",

  "label_scores": {
    "NEGATIVE": 0.999568,
    "NEUTRAL": 0,
    "POSITIVE": 0
  }
}
```

## Limitations

This model has a 1.000 characters per request limit. You can still post texts with more than 1.000 characters, but it will increase the quota usage. For example, a 1.500 characters text will count as 2 requests.
